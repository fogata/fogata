## About Me
Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a tech enthusiast and AI practitioner who loves turning complex problems into elegant solutions. Whether it's coding, deploying AI models, or hitting the gym, I'm always pushing boundaries.

### üîç What I'm Into
- **Artificial Intelligence**: From prompt engineering to fine-tuning models, I'm passionate about building intelligent systems that deliver real value.
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: Exploring everything from traditional ML models to generative AI (like GPT-4) and RAG architectures.
- **.NET & Backend**: Crafting scalable APIs and real-time apps with .NET and SignalR.
- **DevOps**: Containerization, CI/CD, and deploying ML pipelines with tools like Docker and GitHub Actions.
- **Games & Unity**: I love developing immersive experiences and experimenting with AI-powered NPCs.
- **GYM**: Balancing code with cardio‚Äîbecause strong code needs a strong mind and body.

### üå± Currently Growing
I'm focused on practical applications of **Generative AI**, **Azure AI Services**, and **MLOps**, with a particular interest in:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Intelligent chatbots with Azure OpenAI
- ML lifecycle management with MLflow
- AI observability using Evidently

## My Projects
Take a look at some of my repositories to see AI-powered systems, cloud-native apps, and experiments with language models. Whether it's automating LinkedIn content or creating tokenized AI labs, I‚Äôm always building something cool.

**Featured:**
- `linkedin-content-creator` ‚Äî RAG-based content generator for LinkedIn
- `ai-lab-dao` ‚Äî Tokenized AI ecosystem with DAO logic
- `gpt-chatbot-azure` ‚Äî Real-time chatbot using Azure Bot Framework + OpenAI

## Fun Fact
I believe the future of software is intelligent, adaptive, and collaborative. Let's build systems that learn, grow, and empower people.
